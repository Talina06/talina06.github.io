  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead" style="font-size:16px;">
    My career journey has been diverse, starting as a quality engineer at Veritas. 
    Eager to explore entrepreneurial endeavors, I ventured into founding a tech company, where I created a hyper-local retail product catering to Indian fashion brands. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead" style="font-size:16px;">
    Soon after, I joined a fintech company, where I became an integral member of the Site Reliability Engineering team. In this role, I contributed to shaping and implementing SRE practices and culture from the very foundation, & addressing core systems and scalability challenges. 
    My journey led me to Couchbase, where I initially served as a backend systems engineer. Over time, I transitioned into a leadership position, guiding my team in delivering features for Couchbase&#39;s cloud product. 
    This evolution has allowed me to leverage my diverse background and contribute to the continued success and innovation within Couchbase.
    </p> 
    <p class="lead" style="font-size:16px;">
    I’m very determined, a fast-learner, curious and a natural leader. I lead by example and work side by side with my teams. I bring business and product vision to tech teams.

I had this idea of building a tool which can find out the coverage of source code documentation to help other developers. Talina picked up the idea as well as design quickly. She was prompt is asking right set of design questions to iron out the grey areas that made the design robust. She took the lead in planning how to divide the various module as well as tasks assignment based on their interest and areas of interest. She completed her tasks on time with quality. Overall the project went pretty well and in the end as project mentor I was quite happy with the work. Also the project was very well appreciated by External review in their college. Keep up the great work Talina!!"
